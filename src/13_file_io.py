"""
Python makes performing file I/O simple. Take a look
at how to read and write to files here:

"""

# Open up the "foo.txt" file (which already exists) for reading
# Print all the contents of the file, then close the file
# Note: pay close attention to your current directory when trying to open "foo.txt"

# YOUR CODE HERE
with open ("foo.txt") as rFile:
    # // Read out directly from rFile
    # for line in rFile:
    #     print(line)

    # // Capture file contents to a variable and print
    contents = rFile.read()
    print(contents)
rFile.close()

# Open up a file called "bar.txt" (which doesn't exist yet) for
# writing. Write three lines of arbitrary content to that file,
# then close the file. Open up "bar.txt" and inspect it to make
# sure that it contains what you expect it to contain

# YOUR CODE HERE
wFile = open("bar.txt", "w")

wFile.write(" Knock knock \n Who's there? \n Aya Wanna ")

wFile.close()
